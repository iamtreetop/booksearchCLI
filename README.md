# 📚🔎 BookSearcherCLI

## Description
BookSearcherCLI is a CLI search tool which allows you to use the Google Books API to search for books and construct a reading list.  Built with Javascript and Node.

## Functionality
This application enables the user to:

* Type in a query and display a list of 5 books matching that query.
* Each item in the list includes the book's author, title, and publishing company.
* Select a book or books from the five search results displayed and save to a “Reading List”
* View a “Reading List” with all the books the user has selected from their queries -- this is a local reading list and not tied to Google Books’s account features.
